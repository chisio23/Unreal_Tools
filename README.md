UE5 Tools Library

A small, practical collection of Python tools for Unreal Engine 5 focused on editor-side automation and pipeline tasks (MRQ helpers, camera/sequence utilities, and other time-saving scripts). The goal is simple: ship reliable tools you can drop into your project and run, without over-engineering.

This repo will keep growing over time as I add new utilities and improve existing ones.

What you’ll find

Movie Render Queue helpers: quick setup and automation around MRQ jobs.

Camera + Sequencer utilities: generate cameras, create Level Sequences, and batch workflows.

Editor automation: scripts that remove repetitive clicks and keep pipelines consistent.

Requirements

Unreal Engine 5 with Python enabled (Editor Scripting Utilities recommended).

Usage

Each script is meant to be run inside the UE5 Editor (Python console / editor utility). Some scripts require you to set your own asset paths or output directories.

Requests / contributions

Feature requests are welcome. If you need a tool or a specific workflow automated, open an issue with:

what you’re trying to do,

the UE version,

expected inputs/outputs,

and a minimal example.

PRs are also welcome, but keep changes minimal and practical.
